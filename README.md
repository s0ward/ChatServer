# ChatServer
A simple multithreaded chat application

Once that the server is running users can join with the use of telnet / netcat / etc. client.

ex. telnet IP_ADDRESS 9000
    nc IP_ADDRESS 9000
    netcat IP_ADRESS 9000

Note that if you want to join from external IP_ADDRESS and the server is hosted behind a router, the necessery port forwarding needs to be done to allow access to the host from the router.
